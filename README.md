# Semiconductor Supply Chain Graph

Research project which aims to discover interesting or important patterns in the Semiconductor supply chain.

## This includes the following components

1. The Cypher code for to form a neo4j Graph Database to model the whole supply-chain (Schema is included in this repo as well).
2. Jupyter Notebook which step by step imports the data, utilizes it to build the graph database (Should be easy to recreate).
3. .. more to be added later
